# Standup App

> Small app to keep notes of what I did during the day, what I need to do, questions for the team, and what (if anything) is blocking.

## Motivation

I'm currently using a combination of vim + vim-notes for tracking what I do during the day for our daily stand ups, which has been great so far, but why not re-create it in Elm and learn something new?
